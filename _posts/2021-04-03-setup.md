title: Setup
---

I finally got time to set up my own site (again). Since starting work I haven't had much energy / creativity in my spare time. 

The previous site was a MESS. I try to make it look simple, but there were many failed experiments.

Things I tried 
1. Wordpress

wait thats it.

Basically, it was asking me to update database before i even uttered a word. 

EDIT: well i mean i tried a bunch of Javascript stuff too but you know that was just for fun... they were _toys_

The new setup seems to be much better... I:
1. found a theme I like [(darkpoole)](https://github.com/andrewhwanpark/dark-poole).
2. finally figured out [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). 
3. find out that it is much cheaper to renew my domain on [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) and it was an easy setup to point it to github pages
   - I have heard of github pages & jekyll before, but i thought that means you have to use that really lengthy username.github.io domain name, so I didn't bother...


Like, the stars have aligned on this 3-day weekend, so that I can have my own blog on my own domain. and it should be relatively low maintenance (time will tell)

Now if i want to write a new blog post the process is
1. Write a new markdown file
2. push to github 
3. there is no step 3

My costs before:
1. Renewing the domain on google domain (17 dollars / yr) 
1. Hosting on nearlyfreespeech (minimal but non-zero)

My costs after:
1. Renewing the domain on cloudflare (8 dollars / yr) 
1. Hosting with github pages (free)
