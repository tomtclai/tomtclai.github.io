I listened to Sam Harris over the weekend 


He’s a proponent for the provocative idea that 1) the self is an illusion and 2) we don’t have free will

I’ve listened to 1 before so this weekend wasn’t about that. This weekend is more on 2. 

A few seconds before we notice that we are thinking about something. Neuroscientist can already see it happening in our brains. 

Like. Just let that sink in for a moment. Reread it so you understand. 



What does this mean? 

We don’t think our thoughts. Thoughts come to us. 

We don’t choose our thoughts. Thoughts chooses us. 


Crazy right ?  

Whatever you think you are choosing to think. It isn’t totally random. It came from your genes and your experience 

Even if it were totally random. That doesn’t change anything. If the thought  were truly random, then it by definition cannot be caused by you. 

So we’re deterministic. 

I think of myself as a function of gene and memory.
